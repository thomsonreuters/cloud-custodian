and then perform the delete operation on those ready for deletion.

.. code-block:: yaml

    policies:
      - name: mark-test-sql-servers-for-deletion
        resource: azure.sqlserver
        filters:
          - type: value
            key: name
            op: in
            value_type: normalize
            value: test
         actions:
          - type: mark-for-op
            op: delete
            days: 7
      - name: delete-test-sqlservers
        resource: azure.sqlserver
        filters:
          - type: marked-for-op
            op: delete
        actions:
